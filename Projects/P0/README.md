## Reference

A nice guide for git can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control). The subset used here is quite sparse. In particular we need to do git clone/git pull/git push/git commit/git add and git rebase.

Vagrant information can be found (here)[https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/]. Althouhg it is quite usefull, we will use here just as _simplication tool_
