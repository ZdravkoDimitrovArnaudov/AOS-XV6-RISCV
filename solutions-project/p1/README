Project 1:

A) Sorting: For this assignment, the hardest part was getting back in touch with C. It was a good refresher on the commands, I/O, etc. I also ran into problems with big files, however as Professor Remzi stated, I was not calling malloc correctly, and thus my program was crashing because it was trying to store all the records on the stack rather than on the heap. Once I did that, it worked correctly. I did not try to optimize the sorting, however using a two pass sort would have been my approach.

B) Kernel: This was very similar to the last assignment we had for CS 354, which I took this past semester. Not only did it solidify the understanding of what goes on in an interrupt, Professor Remzi pretty much spelled out where and what code needed to be added, which is why this was easy. This assignment gave me practice with the grep command which I had not used previously, which turned out extremely useful for this assignment.
