Operating-Systems
=================

This is the code from the assignments 
for my Operating Systems class that I took at UW-Madison

==============================READ AND ABIDE BY THIS!!!=========================
The intended use of this code is to showcase the class for future employers, 
other universities and people who are looking to learn from this code. 
You may NOT copy and paste the code and then turn in as your own. 
While this may be technically legal, it is morally and ethically wrong, 
and defeats the purpose of learning exercises and the education that you are 
supposed to recieve. This code is provided "as is" and is not actively 
maintained or supported. Use at your own risk.
