To run the tests:

0. Boot vagrant image vpuente/AOSUC
1. Navigate to the base directory of your code
2. From that directory, execute the "runtests" executable in this directory ($LABHOME/Test/P[0..6]/)
3. The test will create a log file in the top or your directory. Add it to the repository in your branch and push it to gitlab. The score obtained will be the score of your assigment.

In $LABHOME/Test/P[1..6]/{ctests,tests} you have the individual tests for each Lab. You can copy and test it 
individually in your working dir for xv6, modifying the 'user/makefile.mk' or just copying 1 by 1 in 
user/tester.c 

For more options available while testing, run '$LABHOME/Test/P[0..6]/runtests -h'
